## How to get vars - [TEAM SPY](https://t.me/devggn)

- `BOT TOKEN`: @Botfather on telegram

- `OWNER_ID`: Go to @missrose_bot, start and send /info to get your id

- `FORCESUB`: Before starting building bots create a public channel and get the username without '@'Make bot admin in that channel.

- `LOG_GROUP`: Get is by copying any post link and extract value just after `https:t.me/c/` and next `/` then after put `-100` before it. Make bot ADMIN in that channel or group.
 
- `API_ID` and `API_HASH`: [Telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
